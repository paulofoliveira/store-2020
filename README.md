# store-2020

This project was updated from Store2018 in http://github.com/cloudacademy/devops.
The project contains tree Backend APIs with ASP.NET Core 3.1 (AccountService, InventoryService and ShoppingCartService) and web app (Store2020) that consumes APIs on Index page.

Until Course One, I saw about Refactor and Redesign one monolith ppplication in Microservices, use Swagger to documentation and containers with Docker Compose to build a complete solution to my app hosted on Github.


# Techonologies
