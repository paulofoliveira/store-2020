# store-2020

This project was updated from Store2018 in http://github.com/cloudacademy/devops.
Contains tree Backend APIs with ASP.NET Core 3.1 (AccountService, InventoryService and ShoppingCartService) and web app (Store2020) that consumes APIs on Index page.

Until Course One, I saw about Refactor and Redesign one monolith application in Microservices, use Swagger to documentation and containers with Docker Compose to build a complete solution with code hosted on Github.

# Techonologies envolved

- ASP.NET Core 3.1 with Restful APIs and MVC
- Swagger to documentation
- Docker Containers with Docker Compose
- Nginx and Supervisord to serve app and manage process
- Github to hosted my source code
